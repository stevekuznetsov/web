Although new to NWAC as an Avalanche Specialist, Lee was a Professional Observer for this area from 2015 through 2020.\n\nOf all the aspects of snow, avalanches and backcountry travel in avalanche terrain, Lee finds observing and learning the nuances of the mountain environment the most fascinating. Why does it snow more on one side of the valley than the other? Why can snowpack change so drastically in a short distance across the same slope? How can minor differences in terrain choice have major implications for personal and group safety? Most importantly, how to communicate this information with others in a clear and consistent manner so they can use it in their own mountain travels?\n\nLee graduated from Seattle University in 1997 with a B.A. in English and quickly put his literary and writing skills to use skiing powder in Little Cottonwood Canyon. After nearly a decade of ski resort work including jobs, such as washing dishes in employee housing, shoveling snow, cleaning hot tubs, and not spilling wine on restaurant guests, he landed on the Snowbird Ski Patrol in 2005.  He began working as a mountain guide in the Cascades a few years later and gained IFMGA certification in 2013. ',
